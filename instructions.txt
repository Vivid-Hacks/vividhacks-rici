RICI (run it code it scioly style)

First, create a discord bot. This discord bot will be in the main discord server.
When time comes, loop through all users in discord server
    For every user, get discord user tag. Then, hash it with the secret key in secrets.json. Then, DM this hash to the user


Server side:
    Have an input for discord tag and the DMed hash value
    On the server, hash the discord tag and secret key together. If this hash matches the DMed hash, then everything is good!
        Send an "ok" response to the client, and a button appears saying "START"
        When user presses start, make another request, with the same discord tag and DMed hash value, this time to a different API endpoint named "/start
        Then, send the code over to the .exe or .app file and start a timer for 60 minutes on frontend AND backend
        The user can submit the finished file to the server whenever they want to.
        At 55 minutes, sound an alarm on the front end saying that they only have 5 minutes left to submit the file
        Give another 5 minute grace period before closing the session and recording the discord tag and blocking further attempts using discord tag

    If it doesn't, then the user is hacking and deny them access


How to make the .exe or .app file:
    Create application in Node.JS and use https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg to create the .exe or .app files
